#### Guidelines

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row">
 
  <div style="width: 70%">

  - The more you participate the more you learn! 
  - ü§Ø The moment you are confused, raise your hand. You're not alone! {.fragment}
  - "I don't know" is OK. Guessing is also OK! Mistakes => Learning! {.fragment}
  - üì∑ on üôè {.fragment}
  </div>
</div>

#### Coding Along (not required!)

  <div style="width: 70%">

  - it can help
  - it can also hurt üò¨ {.fragment}
  - If you get stuck, take a screenshot and refocus on our discussion {.fragment}
  - üí°Everything is recorded! {.fragment}
  - Focus on high level understanding > implementation {.fragment}
  - Comfort solving errors and fixing bugs will come with practice and experience {.fragment}

### My Setup

##### VSCode extensions:

Extension | Description |
---------|----------|
[Draw.io Integation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) | for making diagrams from within VSCode 
[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) | for opening a webpage in the browser that will reload when the code is saved 
[vscode-reveal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evilz.vscode-reveal) | for opening the slide.md files in the browser to display slideshows
[Tabnine AI Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode) | for code completion suggestions based on context
[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) | auto format HTML, JSON, CSS, JS, etc.
[HTML Boilerplate](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sidthesloth.html5-boilerplate) | create html boilerplate 
[Thunder Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client) | run REST API calls in VSCode

</div>

<aside class="notes">
- Show how to do tab extensions <br />
- Tabnine also autocompletes based on what's already in the code (function, var names) <br />
- Be sparing of autocomplete, important to type things out to get used to them <br />
- Thunder Client - similar to Postman but in VSCode, we will use this later 
</aside>

## Lecture Goals

- Describe what functions are
- Regular functions vs arrow functions syntax
- Explain the difference between:
  - Block scope
  - Function scope
  - Global scope
- Understand functions as first-class objects
- Identify higher-order functions
- Define callback functions and higher-order functions

<aside class="notes">
- last 3 are not fully necessary 
</aside>

# Functions

<p align="center">
    <img src="functions.jpeg" width="400" height="250">
</p>

<aside class="notes">
- 2 separate phases: definition (compilation), execution (runtime/invocation) <br />
- tell computer how to remember a certain set of instructions <br />
- may want to repeat set of instructions multiple times
- Definition: storing logic for later use <br />
- Invocation: running logic (maybe with specific value) and returning back with value 
</aside>

<div style="font-size: 0.75em">

### Let's Code!

Function | Parameters | Behavior
---------|----------|---------
 helloWorld | none | returns "Hello, world!"
 formatPrice | price (float) | returns the price like so: "$2.99" 
 blurb | book (obj) | returns a string representation of the book with title author and price

</div>

<aside class="notes">
CODE: #1 helloWorld(), #2 formatPrice(price)

### () => {} vs function() {}

![regular to arrow function conversion](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlzuobe8h/image/upload/v1670868682/phase1/reg-to-arrow-function_bqrtqj.gif)

- syntax {.fragment}
- simplified vs fully featured {.fragment}
- read more about [differences](https://dmitripavlutin.com/differences-between-arrow-and-regular-functions/) (or feel free to bookmark for later) {.fragment}

![arrow function to regular function conversion](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlzuobe8h/image/upload/v1670868681/phase1/arrow-to-reg-function_snfnkx.gif)

<aside class="notes">
- function keyword gets hoisted to top of file scope <br />
- arrow functions not as fully featured <br />
- let, const gets hoisted but the value assigned to it doesn't get hoisted <br />
- arrow functions are super good for callbacks <br />
<br />
CODE: #3, #4, #5a, #5b

</aside>

### Callbacks and HOF

![Callbacks pt1](./callbacks-pt-1.drawio.svg)

<div style="font-size: 0.75em">

#### Higher Order Functions

- accept a function as a parameter
- (and/or) return a function

</div>

<aside class="notes">
- CB function: function we pass to another function (e.g. setTimeOut/setInterval, <strong>addEventListener</strong>) <br />
- function that accepts CB: higher-order function <br />
- if we use CB solely for that higher-order function, we may be able to define it anonymously <br /><br />
</aside>

### Callbacks and Iteration

#### Scope & The Scope Chain
![Scope and the Scope Chain](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlzuobe8h/image/upload/v1665447423/1_S9gu5XK8LBTSVddsGdBtGg_kq2mnh.png)

[Awesome Blog post on Scope and the Scope Chain](https://medium.com/joonsikyang/scope-and-the-scope-chain-27216a853a4e)

<aside class="notes">
- scope: about access, describes area in which a particular piece of info is available  <br />
- certain things in code create new scope, scope chain responsible for resolving variable access (will go through current scope to top of chain) <br >
- global scope: top of scope chain, accessible to everything in code <br />
- function scope: each fxn creates a new scope, vars inside fxn are not available outside of fxn <br />
- block scope: use let/const to control scope, variable will only exist inside of the scope (for, if, while, etc.)<br />
- var will be accessible outside of block scope <br />
- applies to us: where do I need access to information, note .map/.forEach iterations <br />
- where you define variable determines its scope <br />
